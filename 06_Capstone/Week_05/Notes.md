# Week 5 Notes

## Reflection on week 4 tasks
I was not able to get the mongodb connections going yet for storing meals and calendars for the user.  
Still some work to be done on the collaborative piece as well.

# TODO for week 5
* more testing of app
* continue working on feature set
* create technical demo video
* test and finalize app
* allow user to create meals and calendars
* allow user to share calendars with other users
